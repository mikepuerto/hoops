# Hoops.js

## Introduction

<span style="color: red">I think the sockets should be an optional "add-on / plugin / hook / whatever we decide to call them"</span>

Hoops.js is an api / web service framework for Node.js. It handles traffic via RESTful http api's as well as WebSockets. All http traffic is handled by  [express]() and all WebSockets by [socket.io](). In hoops all of your http routes automatically get a WebSocket event bound. Hoops.js aims to be as lightweight and non-opinionated as possible with our "adapater" approach to building different pieces of the framework.
